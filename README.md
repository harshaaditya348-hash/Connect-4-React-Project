# Connect-4-React-Project
Built a browser-based Connect-4 game using React.js and JavaScript (ES6). Designed reusable components for the game board and pieces, implemented React Hooks for state management, and developed custom algorithms for win detection, draw handling, and computer-generated moves. Emphasized performance, modular design, and responsive UI.
